## Homework Assignment: Automate Your Day Job with Python
---
### Background
---

It's time to put away the Excel sheet and join the big leagues. In this homework assignment, I'll be using the concepts I've learned to complete two Python activities, PyBank and PyRamen. Both activities present a real-world situation in which my newfound Python skills will come in handy.

In this activity, I am tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of the company. I was provided with a financial dataset in this file: budget_data.csv. This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses.

My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


* The total number of months included in the dataset.



* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.



* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.



* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.



* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
